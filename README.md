## Dealership-Sales-Analysis
### Introduction
The Dealership-Sales-Analysis project explores automotive market performance through a detailed dataset of car sales across different makes, models, years, and regions.
It aims to uncover data-driven insights that can support business strategy, pricing optimization, and inventory management decisions within the automotive industry.

### Project Overview
This analysis uses SQL, Snowflake, and PowerBI to process, analyze, and visualize vehicle sales data.
The dataset includes variables such as sale date, selling price, make, model, odometer reading, condition, and region.
Through a combination of data transformation, aggregation, and interactive dashboard design, this project delivers insights into top-performing brands, regional sales trends, and factors influencing vehicle prices.

### Project Objectives

- The main objectives are to:

- Identify top-performing makes and models based on total revenue and unit sales.

- Analyze sales distribution across provinces, sellers, and years.

- Understand how vehicle condition and mileage affect selling price.

- Determine seasonal or monthly sales trends and peak sale periods.

- Compare average selling prices across makes, models, and vehicle years.

- Provide actionable insights for pricing strategies, inventory forecasting, and marketing decisions.
